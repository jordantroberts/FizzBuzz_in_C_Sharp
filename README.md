# FizzBuzz in C#

First time learning Python - TDDing the FizzBuzz kata to practice. I used NUnit to test.

## FizzBuzz Rules

Prints numbers 1 to 100. The program will print the number unless:

If the number is a multiple of 3, it will print "Fizz"
If the number is a multiple of 5, it will print "Buzz"
If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it will print "FizzBuzz"
